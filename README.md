# Chess-Dataset-Analysis
Analysis of chess games

This project analyzes a dataset of over 20,000 chess games collected from users on the Lichess.org website. The dataset includes game IDs, start and end times, number of turns, player IDs and ratings, and more.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

* Python 3
* pandas
* matplotlib

## Data Cleaning
The raw dataset had missing values and columns that were not useful for our analysis. We cleaned the data by dropping unnecessary columns and removing rows with missing values.

## Data Analysis
We conducted several analyses on the dataset to explore different aspects of the games, including:

Correlation between player ratings and game outcomes
Average rating difference between players and its relation to game outcomes
Distribution of game lengths in terms of moves
How time control of a game affects player ratings and game outcomes
We visualized the results using histograms and scatter plots.

## Conclusion
Through our analysis, we found that higher-rated players tend to win more often and that there is a strong correlation between player ratings and game outcomes. We also discovered interesting trends in game lengths and how they vary based on the outcome and time control.

Future Work
In the future, we could expand our analysis to include other factors that may affect game outcomes, such as the opening moves played or the time of day the game was played. We could also train a machine learning model to predict game outcomes based on player ratings and other factors.
